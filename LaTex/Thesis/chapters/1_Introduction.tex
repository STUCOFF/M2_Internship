\begin{itemize}
	\item Context: osteoporose study
	\item Need: study bone structure in nano scale
	\item Tool: CT scan in ESRF
	\item Problem: High dose, change in sample composition, motion, radiations...
	\item Solution: Use of compress sensing to perform low dose reconstruction
	\item Problem: not so much work in nano scale and nothing on biological samples
	\item Proposed methode: iterative TV denoising 2D and 3D. Study the low dose reduction factor with biological sample, and study possibility of extention using 3D TV.
	\item Plan description
