\chapter{Theoretical Foundations for the Solution}
\textit{This is a generic title. Replace it with an actual title that describes the context of the work. \\
Describe in abstract (theoretical) terms how the proposed approach can be implemented and how to solve related sub problems.  Use the state of the art as an analysis tool. }\\
