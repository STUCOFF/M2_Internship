\chapter{Experimental Performance Evaluation or validation of solution}
\textit{This is a generic title. Replace it with an actual title that describes the context of the work.\\
Describe the  performance metrics, experimental hypotheses,  experimental conditions, test data, and expected results.  Provide the test data.  Interpret the results of the experiments.  Pay special attention to cases where the experiments give no information or did not come out as expected.  Draw lessons and conclusions from the experiments. Explain how additional experiments could validate or confirm results.}\\

\section{Hypothesis}
\begin{itemize}
	\item CS can be used to preserve image quality
	\item Can reduce dose and make a scalable algorithm
	\item SB can be implemented at ESRF
	\item Can use it on Bonse data
\end{itemize}

\section{Data-set description}

\section{Experiments description}

\section{Results}

\begin{itemize}
	\item show images compare to FBP
	\item computation time
	\item error rates
	\item compare corronal sagital and axial views
	\item 3D not as good as expected? Why? How to make ferther tests to understand why?
\end{itemize}
