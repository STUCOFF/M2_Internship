\chapter{Experimental Performance Evaluation or validation of solution}
\textit{This is a generic title. Replace it with an actual title that describes the context of the work.\\
Describe the  performance metrics, experimental hypotheses,  experimental conditions, test data, and expected results.  Provide the test data.  Interpret the results of the experiments.  Pay special attention to cases where the experiments give no information or did not come out as expected.  Draw lessons and conclusions from the experiments. Explain how additional experiments could validate or confirm results.}\\

\begin{itemize}
	\item show images compare to FBP
	\item computation time
	\item error rates
	\item compare corronal sagital and axial views
	\item 3D not as good as expected? Why? How to make ferther tests to understand why?
